# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to the versioning scheme described in `CLAUDE.md`
(SemVer tied to roadmap phases, not to feature-by-feature bumps).

The full reasoning behind a change — not just what changed — lives in the
annotated git tag (`git tag -n99 vX.Y.Z`) and, for standing decisions, in
`CLAUDE.md`. This file is the short version.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - phase 1 patch

### Added
- `hours_source: "mixed"` for a run with both a stated baseline and measured
  sessions.
- Obsidian game notes carry an `aliases: [title]` field, so the quick switcher
  finds a note by the title someone actually types.
- Run notes carry a denormalized `cover` property, used by the Shelf cards
  view and the Game List table.

### Changed
- `search` ranks provider results by how many platforms match
  `config.platforms`, and widens the raw IGDB fetch so a platform-tagged match
  is no longer lost below the old top-8 cutoff.
- `search --platform` and `amend --set platform=...` now canonicalize through
  the platform table (e.g. `PSX` matches a provider's "PlayStation").
- `start --past-hours` and `past` filed without `--ended` now open a run with
  a stated baseline and no session, instead of implying one starts now.
- Everything the `obsidian` target writes now lives under `obsidian/`, not the
  vault root — `assets/` stays at the vault root, `obsidian/assets` is a
  symlink to it.
- `Games.md` / `Games.base` renamed to `Game List.md` / `Game Database.base`
  (both used to display as a bare, indistinguishable "Games").
- Run notes are named `<started_on>-<slug>.md`, date first, so a plain
  filename sort is chronological.

### Fixed
- The non-interactive candidate listing no longer leaks a literal
  `"{platforms}"` placeholder into its own output.
- A real Obsidian Bases parse failure (`groupBy` needs both `property` and
  `direction`).

### Removed
- The RAWG provider (offline since before it was first noted). IGDB is the
  only provider now.

## [0.1.1] - phase 1 patch

### Changed
- `enrich --covers` now runs the provider's cover URL through the same
  normalize/hash/assets pipeline `--photo` uses, instead of only storing the
  URL. `game.enrich`'s `cover` field carries `{ url, sha256 }`.

### Fixed
- A `source: user` cover is never overwritten by enrichment, and is never
  even fetched over.

## [0.1.0] - Phase 1 — Metadata, images and query

### Added
- Provider credentials and enrichment (IGDB/RAWG behind a common interface),
  ambiguity resolved as candidates/menu, platform-aware narrowing from
  recorded runs.
- `sqlite`, `json`, and `html` build targets.
- `query` and `import` commands.
- Image ingestion: EXIF read then stripped, normalize, hash,
  content-addressed `assets/<sha[0:2]>/<sha>.webp`, and its CLI surface
  (`--photo`, `--caption`, `--kind`, `--as-cover`, `attach`, `cover`, the
  gallery block).
- Platform vocabulary: canonicalization, suggestion groups, late-fill on
  close.

328 tests, no network in the default test suite.

## [0.0.0] - Phase 0 — The register, no AI

### Added
- Event log: append, fold, amend/revoke.
- Duration arithmetic, local resolution.
- Recording and query commands, `verdict`.
- `build` as a target registry with manifest-based ownership.
- The `obsidian` and `csv` targets.
- `doctor`.

136 tests, no network in the test suite.
